# Spring-Boot-application
Classes Book and Author are @Entity classes. We have two tables for the entities and their attributes . There are primary keys @Id for Author and Book. In the REST part there are BookController and AuthorController where are the methods and we can update, delete, add books, and for the authors we can find specific author by his id. Also, in service part there are BookService and AuthorService,  @Component appropriate for the entities. Of course, with the jUnit test we can test the application and that is in the test part. When we start the application, we can test it in Postman sending the request GET http://localhost:8080/books/1 and we get the response.
